  /* The difference between the three types of errors are that a logical error occurs 
  * when your code compiles but does not give the result you expect. For example 
  * in Java if you the quotient of 3 / 5 would be 0 (not 0.6) and the remainder 3. 
  * If you misspell any code or words when adding code Java can detect it and that 
  * is the error that would come up called syntax error and IDE’s will highlight 
  * the error of syntax in color. For example, if your program in Java had variable 
  * int age = 17.5 created (in Java can’t convert 17.5 to int and it is syntax error 
  * as you can’t lose fractional part. Whereas the run time error is different from 
  * logic and syntax error, is a type of exception meaning the program encounters 
  * unexpected input that is unable to deal with it. For example nextInt() 
  * method is only used to read and return an integer only, if you enter other 
  * types of data the program will say run time error and crash.
