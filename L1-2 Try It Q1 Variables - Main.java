  /* In Java it is a statically typed language meaning you need to define a name 
  * and the kind of specific value for the variable such as integer (int), 
  * boolean value- (boolean) or a real number so Java stores it as a variable. 
  * Then after a variable is declared in Java the name and type can’t be changed, 
  * but the value stored in the variable can be changed while the program runs. 
  * However, in Python you don’t really need to declare a variable since it is 
  * dynamically typed meaning they can store any type of data while the program runs. 
  * That's the difference between declaring variables in Java vs Python.
