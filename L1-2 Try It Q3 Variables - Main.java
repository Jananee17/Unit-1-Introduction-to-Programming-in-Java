  /* LastChoice, two times and true are incorrect and they do not follow Java style conventions. 
  * Since first one both words are capitalized first letter, two times wrong since both are 
  * lowercase first letter and true is boolean, not a variable word that can be used. 
  * The ones that would give compiler errors are _system, $1 and third-choice are not 
  * allowed because first one _ is allowed bat can’t start in beginning with _, second 
  * one $1 is wrong will give error since you can’t start it with $ and third-choice is 
  * wrong since your not allowed to use - for variable name.
