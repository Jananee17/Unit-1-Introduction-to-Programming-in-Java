  /* If you spell for example print wrong in println code instead it says 
  * System.out.pirntln() Java will say it's wrong in red. It says its error because the 
  * symbol cannot be found since print is spelled wrong. Another error could 
  * be you forgot to add the semicolon ----> ;  after the new line of code 
  * and in Java it detects an error in red saying expected ;. 
  * Meaning you needed to add a semicolon. Then where it needs to be added 
  * there is a red squiggly line on the line where the semicolon is missing.
